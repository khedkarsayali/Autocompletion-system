<b>Autocompletion system for coding assistance</b>


An intelligent autocompletion system that assists users while writing general text or programming code. It supports both normal typing mode and coding mode, making it ideal for writers, students, and developers.



<b>Problem Statement</b>
Typing speed and accuracy are essential in both casual writing and coding. However, repetitive typing, typos, and a lack of smart suggestions often slow users down.
This project addresses the problem by implementing a Trie-based autocompletion system that suggests relevant words or code snippets as users type, reducing effort and improving productivity.


<b>Objectives</b>
Implement an efficient autocomplete system using the Trie data structure.

Provide two modes:


Normal Mode for general English word completion.


Coding Mode for autocompleting programming terms and syntax.


Enable custom word insertion for both dictionaries to improve adaptability.


Offer a GUI interface with theme switching and easy navigation.
